# BochenekOrderApp
My first bigger project created for my neighbor's small company.
That's WPF app with Caliburn.Micro (MVVM model).

It's designed to create order cards and export them to png images which are saved in directories.
App has simple interface, form and dynamically generated preview of table with order's data.
